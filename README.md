The main idea of this desktop aplication is to provide a torrent magnet of the selected movie, so that you can watch it on your favorite torrent client. The HomePage contains a gridViewList of the popular movies. It has *infinite scroll* integrated, which will load more movies when scrolling down the page. When selecting a movie, the details page pops out. It contains the complete movie information, such as genre, directors and rating.

You can add or remove a movie to favorites by clicking on the heart next to the title. Below, you will find two buttons. One is for watching the movie trailer and the other shows a list of magnets that you can copy and paste it on your favorite torrent client. If the magnet does not exists, a message will replace the button by saying that the movie is unavailable.

A search engine is also integrated. It will display the movie only if the magnet exists.
